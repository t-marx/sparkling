# Introduction

This report presents the second of the two projects required for the PH125.9x Capstone module of the EdX/HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science.

As a French person, I feel that Champagne is quite an important part of the national image of France. However, how do you rate a good Champagne? Will an average Champagne rate better than an
average non-Champagne sparkling wine? More generally, can you model the rating of a sparkling wine based on a number of factors, possibly diffenciating real Champagnes from other wines? 

This project consists in building a sparkling wines database, then constructing two machine learning models, each of which assessed through three algorithms.

The first model aims, after an exploratory data analysis step (which will exhibit some specific relations between a wine rating and other variables), at proposing different algorithms to
classify the quality of a sparkling wine among three categories, based on a few explanatory variables.

The second one will attempt to model the lexical field used to described spakling wines, and to infer from this whether a given wine is a Champagne or not.

# Dataset construction

While both [Kaggle](https://https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/) and the [UCI Machine learning repositiry](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine/) have large,
clean datasets on wine, they did not encompass specifically sparkling wines. We thus turned to [Wine Enthusiast Magazine](https://www.winemag.com/), and used their search engine
to identify the URL format of [sparkling wine reviews](https://www.winemag.com/varietals/sparkling/?search_type=all&page=1).

We then used the web scraping functions of the *rvest* package to :

1. load each consecutive page of listings summary (each page containing 20 boxes, from which the URL to the individual review, the professional rating, the price and the occasional reviewer badge were collected);  

2. access each individual rating page, and obtain from there the review text, the appellation, the specific desgination of the bottle, the name of the domain,
the alcoholic content of the wine and the bottle size. We did not retrieve the "user average rating" since it appeared to be scarecely populated, nor the "variety" of grapes
(always a blend; analysis of the review text was more helpful in that matter), nor the review date (as it was coded inconsistenly in the webpage depending on the wine).

From a navigator user point of view, the first step corresponds to the analysis of pages under the following format: 
 
```{r wine-list, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "75%"}
include_graphics("./images/1-sparkling-list.png")
```

\pagebreak

The second one corresponds to the analysis of individual wine pages under the following format: 
 
```{r wine-individual, echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "75%"}
include_graphics("./images/2-sparkling-individual.png")
```
 
The relevant fields were identified in terms of CSS code through the use of the [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) plugin for Google Chrome.
 
This information was then put in a data frame, and the variables converted to numeric when necessary, while treating the outliers due to input errors and NA values (badge and vintage).
Additional factors were computed, extracting (through the *stringr* package) review length information from the review text, and removing the author first & last names. While it should
normally have been an interesting modelling factor, a first analysis suggested a strong relationship between the reviewer name and the type of wine, in particular with a bijection between
Champagnes and Roger Voss. Hence, keeping the reviewer name in the review text would have given away the wine type too easily in our models and/or lead to colinearity issues.

We also extracted the specific appellation and country of production from the appellation field (expression occurring respectively before the first comma and after the last one).
 
We initially intended to construct a factor regarding the optimal drink time (based on the review text analysis), but were confronted to three issues:  

1. Most reviewers did not provide such recommandation, which was for a large part limited to Roger Voss, the site Champagne expert (which makes sense: non-Champagne sparkling wines are not really expected
to benefit from longer bottle aging); 
 
2. When it was provided, the optimal drink date was taking different formats (a specific year, "now", "a few years"), making it hard to encode; 
 
3. Extracting a four-digit figure starting with "20" expecting to grab the optimal drink date was not feasible, as it could also capture disgorgement time (a factor we initially intended to incorporate in
our models, but finally left aside due to its scarce mentions).

# Exploratory data analysis
 
## Dataset review
 
To start assessing how wines characteristics affect the rating, we start with a display of the header of the dataset, orderered by ascending points:
 
```{r head-asc, echo=FALSE}
wines %>%
  arrange(.,points) %>%
  head(.,3) %>%
  pander(.)
```

\pagebreak

then by descending points:
```{r head-desc, echo=FALSE}
wines %>%
  arrange(.,-points) %>%
  head(.,3) %>%
  pander(.)
```

\pagebreak

and then some basic statistics, to assess the range of values and types of variables (after cleaning):
 
```{r base-stats, echo=FALSE}
pander(summary(wines))
```

\pagebreak

The main take-aways from this review are: 
 
1. At time of scraping, there were `r nrow(wines)` sparkling wines reviewed on Wine Spectator, from `r length(unique(wines[,"domain"]))` domains;  

2. They represent `r length(unique(wines[,"appellation"]))` appellations, with Champagne covering `r sum(wines$appellation == 'Champagne')` wines;  

3. Alcohol grades are mostly in the traditional 12 to 12.5° range, but there are some outliers;  

4. While mid-size bottles were reviewed, no large format (magnum, jeroboam or larger, generally considered as offering better evolution perspectives) were reviewed; 

5. Review ratings range from `r min(wines$points)` to `r max(wines$points)` points;  

6. The prices range from `r min(wines$price)` to `r max(wines$price)` USD, with a median of `r median(wines$price)` USD;  

7. Review length varies wildly, from a single character (a single space, to ensure the field is populated) to `r max(wines$rev_length)` (though the kurtosis should be low, considering the 1st and 3rd quarter levels).

## Graphical analysis
 
Let's first check how ratings are distributed:

```{r dist-wines-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
wines %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=points)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, color="black") +
  xlab("Rating points") +
  ylab("Number of wines") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of wines by rating")
```

```{r dist-champ-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
wines %>%
  filter(appellation == 'Champagne') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=points)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, color="black") +
  xlab("Rating points") +
  ylab("Number of Champagnes") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Champagnes by rating")
```

```{r dist-vintchamp-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
wines %>%
  filter(appellation == 'Champagne') %>%
  filter(!wine_year == 'None') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=points)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1, color="black") +
  xlab("Rating points") +
  ylab("Number of Vintage Champagnes") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Vintage \n Champagnes by rating")
```

\pagebreak

We now plot relationships between some variables and ratings:

```{r rel-price-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
wines %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=price,y=points)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Price (USD)") +
  ylab("Points") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between price and rating")
```

```{r rel-price-rating-champ, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
wines %>%
  filter(appellation == 'Champagne') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=price,y=points)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Price (USD)") +
  ylab("Points") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between price and rating \n (Champagnes only)")
```

```{r rel-revlength-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
wines %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=rev_length,y=points)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Length of review (characters)") +
  ylab("Points") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between \n review length and rating")
```

```{r rel-alcohol-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
wines %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=alcohol,y=points)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Alcohol content (%)") +
  ylab("Points") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between \n alcohol content and rating")
```

```{r badge-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
wines %>%
  group_by(badge) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=badge,y=points)) +
  geom_violin() +
  xlab("Badge") +
  ylab("Points") +
  ggtitle("Relationship between \n badge and rating") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

\pagebreak

We now plot relationships between origin variables and ratings:

```{r dist-country-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4.3}
wines %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(n() > 20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=country,y=points)) +
  geom_violin() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Points") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of ratings by country (> 20 wines reviewed)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

```{r dist-appell-rating, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 7, , fig.height = 4.3}
wines %>%
  group_by(appellation) %>%
  filter(n() > 250) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=str_trunc(appellation, 20),y=points)) +
  geom_violin() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Points") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of ratings by main appellation (> 250 wines reviewed)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

\pagebreak

Finally, we plot relationships between origin variables and prices:

```{r dist-country-price, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 7, , fig.height = 4.3}
wines %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  filter(n() > 20) %>%
  filter(price < 300) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=country,y=price)) +
  geom_violin() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Price (USD)") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of prices (< 300 USD) by country (> 20 wines reviewed)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

```{r dist-appell-price, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.width = 7, , fig.height = 4.3}
wines %>%
  filter(price < 300) %>%
  group_by(appellation) %>%
  filter(n() > 250) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=str_trunc(appellation, 20),y=price)) +
  geom_violin() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Price (USD)") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of prices (< 300 USD) by main appellation (> 250 wines reviewed)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```


\pagebreak

From these different graphics, we can infer the following relations: 

1. The distrbution of ratings appears to be roughly bell-shaped, aside from an under-representation of the 89 rating (probably for psychological reasons, 90 being the threshold for entry among very good wines); 

2. Actual Champagnes tend to be rated higher (mode at 90 instead of 88 for the whole population), with a distribution skewed to the right (as well as a fatter right tail, compared to a fat left tail for the whole population); 

3. This phenomenon is even more exacerbated for Vintage Champagnes, with a mode at 93 and an even stronger right skew; 

4. The amplitude of price range tends to grow with rating levels; however, as we don't know if tastings were blind, it is difficult to assess whether ratings were influenced by prices. In addition, the minimum price
of a sparkling wine for a given rating tends to rise with the rating;  

5. The universe of Champagnes exhibits similar behaviours in terms of price / rating relation, which suggests that reviews were done fairly, on their own merit between all sparkling wines;  

6. Better-rated wines tend to have longer reviews, which could be the expression of a higher enthusiasm, or more details regarding subtle notes of more complex wines;  

7. There does not appear to be a clear relationship between alcohol contents and ratings, though we observe that low-alcohol wines (less thant 10 °) tend to be capped in their ratings;  

8. While no-badge wines can be found across all rating levels, each of the three explicit badges seems to *de facto* cover a specific rating range: 85 to 90 points for 'Best Buy', 90 to 100 points for 'Cellar Selection'
and 90 to 95 points for 'Editor's Choice';  

9. The distribution of ratings by country exhibits a specific French behavior (only country covering the whole rating range, and in particular only country to register perfect scores),
which the ratings by appellation graphic shows is largely attributable to Champagnes (only wines to register perfect scores) ;  

10. Finally, the distribution of prices by country does not repeat this French exception, as US or English wines appear to have a similar distribution (for wines below 300 USD), including with a higher
entry-price for UK.


## Take-aways from the EDA for the modelling


This analysis gave us some hints as to interesting models that could be applied to this dataset:  

1. A classification model among wine qualities could be applied bassed on a few explanatory variables, selected among those having showed the strongest correlation with ratings (country, price and review length);  

2. A regression model could be applied on the review text corpus, so as to verify if the sole review text is sufficient to distinguish between a Champagne and a non-Champagne wine.


\pagebreak
 
# Modelling approach

## First model : classification of wines among three quality levels

The first of the two meachine-learning models will be a classification-based one. The objective of our classification algorithms (we will compare three of them) is to predict to which of
three quality categories a wine from the test set belongs, based on the explanatory variables. We will judge the three algorithms based on their accuracy.

We start by reencoding wine ratings intro three quality categories:  

* 'Low' for ratings from 80 to 87 points;  

* 'Average' for ratings from 88 to 90 points;  

* 'High' for ratings from 91 to 100 points.

These three categories have roughly similar populations:

```{r class-pop, echo = FALSE}
wines_class %>%
  group_by(Quality = quality) %>%
  summarise(Population = n()) %>%
  pander(.)
```

After setting a seed, we construct training and test sets along a 90/10 line. We also define a resampling parameter (*trControl*) as 5-fold cross-validation (*i.e.* the training set is divided
into five subsamples of equal size, with four of them used for training the model and the last one used for validation; this process is repeated five times, with each subsample being used
once and only once as validation).

Before training each algorithm, we will set a seed to ensure reproducible results.


### First algorithm: Random Forest

We start with a standard algorithm for this kind of classification exercise, a Random Forest with 1000 trees (as suggested by the litterature) and a node size at 1 (better for classification);

We tried the different possible values of the *mtry* parameter (*i.e.* 1, 2 and 3 in our case), and a value of 3 gives the best accuracy.

The model is thus expressed as such:

```{r rf-model, eval = FALSE}
rf_model <- randomForest(quality ~ price + rev_length + country,
                         data = wines_class_train,
                         importance = TRUE,
                         ntree = 1000,
                         nodesize = 1,
                         mtry = 3,
                         trControl = trainControl)
```

\pagebreak

which leads to the following variable importance graphic:

```{r rf-var-imp, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.width= 6}
varImpPlot(rf_model, main = "Variable importance")
```

We then use the *predict* function, then build the confusion matrix, from which we extract the accuracy:

```{r rf-pred, eval = FALSE}
rf_pred <- predict(rf_model, wines_class_test)
confusionMatrix(rf_pred, wines_class_test$quality)
```

We then start to build a table comparing the accuracies of our three algorithms:

```{r rf-acc, echo = FALSE}
pander(rf_acc)
```


### Second algorithm: Classification and Regression Trees (CART), with bagging

A similar approach to random forests is CART, which we try to enhance through bagging, so as to reduce variance and minimize overfitting. To that end, we use
the *train* function of the *caret* package with a *treebag* model, along with the aforementioned 5-fold cross-validation training control.

This model is expressed as such:

```{r tree-model, eval = FALSE}
tree_model <- train(quality ~ price + rev_length + country,
                    data = wines_class_train,
                    method = "treebag",
                    trControl = trainControl)
```

\pagebreak

We then use once again the *predict* function and build the confusion matrix:

```{r tree-pred, eval = FALSE}
tree_pred <- predict(tree_model, wines_class_test)
confusionMatrix(tree_pred, wines_class_test$quality)
```

And we add this accuracy to our comparison table:

```{r rf-tree-acc, echo = FALSE}
pander(bind_rows(rf_acc, tree_acc))
```


### Third algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors

The third classification algorithm used is K-nearest neighbors, which we will train with a grid for the *k* parameter (number of neighbors) ranging from 1 to 10.

```{r knn-model, eval = FALSE}
knn_model <- train(quality ~ price + rev_length + country,
                   data = wines_class_train,
                   method = "knn",
                   trControl = trainControl,
                   tuneGrid = expand.grid(k = 1:10))
```

A comment in the model object suggests a parameter of k = 1 was used as optimal.

We proceed one last time with the *predict* and *confusionMatrix* functions:

```{r knn-pred, eval = FALSE}
knn_pred <- predict(knn_model, wines_class_test)
confusionMatrix(knn_pred, wines_class_test$quality)
```

And we get the final line of our classification algorithm comparison table:

```{r rf-tree--knn-acc, echo = FALSE}
pander(bind_rows(rf_acc, tree_acc, knn_acc))
```

\pagebreak


## Second model: identifying if a sparkling wine is a Champagne

As we observed in the EDA part, there is a relatively strong correlation between the rating of a wine and the length of its review (which has justified including *rev_length* as one of the three
explanatory variables in the first model). However, can we do more, and use text mining to analyze the corpus of the text review, and guess from there if a wine is a Champagne, based solely on
the text of its review?

To that effect, we will use in particular two packages:

* *text2vec* for text vectorization;  

* *glmnet* for fast lasso regularization on generalized linear models regressions on these vectors.

From our webscraped and cleaned dataset, we extract only the review text and appellation, then set a binary variable (1 if the appellation is Champagne, 0 otherwise), and drop the appellation
column. Our new dataset is thus of the following form:

```{r head-t2v, echo = FALSE}
pander(head(wines_t2v,4))
```
We then do a partition of the dataset between Champagnes and non-Champagnes, and use the *Corpus* and *tm_map* functions of the *tm* package to produce a standardized (lower case, without
spaces, punctuation or numbers) corpus of each subset. We remove the words "champagne", "wine" and "drink" along with stop-words (common, short function words with little informational content).

We can then draw word clouds of the most common words for each category.

\pagebreak

* For Champagnes:  
```{r cloud-champ, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}
set.seed(2020)
wordcloud(corpus_champ, scale = c(5, 0.5), min.freq = 15, max.words = 60, random.order = FALSE, rot.per = 0.33,
          colors = brewer.pal(4,"Set2"))
```

* For non-Champagnes:  
```{r cloud-nochamp, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}
set.seed(2020)
wordcloud(corpus_nochamp, scale = c(5, 0.5), min.freq = 15, max.words = 60, random.order = FALSE, rot.per = 0.33,
          colors = brewer.pal(4,"Set2"))
```

We can observe that while the vocabulary is roughly similar between both categories, term frequencies do vary. For example, under the set seed, "acid" is one of the key term of the corpus describing
Champagnes, while it is relatively secondary for non-Champagnes. The opposite occurs for "apple".

It shoud thus be possible to use these differences in vocabulary to construct vocabulary vectors, and conduct regression on these variables to assess whether a given wine review refers to a Champagne or not.

To that effect, we first partition (after setting a seed) the reduced dataset (text of review and binary variable for Champagnes) into training and test subsets, then use the *itoken* function of the *text2vec*
package to tokenize the text of the review of the train subset. We then use the *create_vocabulary* (removing the obvious "champagne" as stopword) and *vocab_vectorizer* functions
of this package to obtain the vectors of the training set, which will be used as explanatory variables in the regression (after a ultimate transformation in Document Term Matrix format).

```{r dtm-train, eval = FALSE}
token_train <- itoken(wines_t2v_train$review, 
                      preprocessor = tolower,
                      tokenizer = word_tokenizer)

vectors <- create_vocabulary(token_train, stopwords = "champagne") %>%
  vocab_vectorizer(.)

dtm_train <- create_dtm(token_train, vectors)
```

We tokenize as well the test set, which we transform in DTM using the training set-based vectors.

```{r dtm-test, eval = FALSE}
token_test <- itoken(wines_t2v_test$review, 
                     preprocessor = tolower,
                     tokenizer = word_tokenizer)

dtm_test <- create_dtm(token_test, vectors)
```

We will now test three variations of a similar 5-fold GLM algorithm, on three versions of the DTMs:  

1. With the base DTMs;  

2. With pruned, N-grams vectors;  

3. With a TF-IDF transformation of the DTMs.


### First algorithm: base Document Term Matrices

The *cv.glmnet* function of the *glmnet* package does cross-validation on the sequence of models provided by the *glmnet* function. The underlying modelling will be a logistic regression
(with binomial distribution), with a lasso penalty ($\alpha$ = 1). As for the cross validation, we will use a five-fold one and a criterion of Area under curve. The model will thus be expressed as:

```{r glmnet-train, eval = FALSE}
glmnet_train <- cv.glmnet(x = dtm_train,
                          y = wines_t2v_train$isChamp, 
                          family = "binomial",
                          alpha = 1,
                          type.measure = "auc",
                          nfolds = 5)
```

\pagebreak

Run on the base DTMs, this model gives the following AUCs as a function of log($\lambda$):

```{r glmnet-train-auc, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=4.5, fig.align='center'}
plot(glmnet_train)
```

for a maximum AUC value of `r round(max(glmnet_train$cvm),4)`.

We can then use this model (with maximum AUC) to run our prediction (with a *response* type given the GLM modelling). The resulting prediction will be transformed in a binary variable
based on a threshold of 0.5.

```{r glmnet-predict, eval = FALSE}
glmnet_pred <- predict(glmnet_train, dtm_test, type = 'response')[,1]

glmnet_res <- data.frame(cbind(test = wines_t2v_test$isChamp,
                               pred = ifelse(glmnet_pred>0.5,1,0)))
```

After running the *confusionMatrix* function on these results (transformed as factors), we start building our table comparing accuracies of the three algorithms (which in fact
are just one algorithm, run over three sligthly diffrent versions of the DTMs).

```{r glmnet-acc, echo = FALSE}
pander(glmnet_acc)
```


### Second algorithm: N-grams with pruning

This algorithm will use the same modelling approach as before, but on a filtered input vocabulary. We first create the vocabulary based on 1-gram and 2-grams, then impose some restrictions
on the minimum number of occurrences of each term over all documents, as well as on the maximum proportion of documents which contain this term. The corresponding code looks like this: 

```{r pruned-vectors, eval = FALSE}
pruned_vectors <- prune_vocabulary(create_vocabulary(token_train,
                                                     stopwords = "champagne",
                                                     ngram = c(1L, 2L)),
                                   term_count_min = 10,
                                   doc_proportion_max = 0.5) %>%
  vocab_vectorizer(.)
```

We then use these new vectors to create pruned DTMs, both for the training and test datasets, and we run the same model as before on the pruned DTMs. We get the following set of AUCs:

```{r glmnet-png-train-auc, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=4.5, fig.align='center'}
plot(glmnet_png_train)
```

After running the prediction and confusion matrix functions as before, we can add a new accuracy to our table:

```{r glmnet-png-acc, echo = FALSE}
pander(bind_rows(glmnet_acc, glmnet_png_acc))
```

### Third algorithm: TF-IDF transformation

Our third algorithm will use another transformation of the base vocabulary, by increasing the weight of terms specific to a few of the documents and decreasing that of terms
encountered in a vast majority of documents. That transformation is known as Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

We first need to create a neww *TfIdf* model object, then use the *fit_transform* function to apply the TF-IDF transformation to our training DTM. We proceed slightly differently
for the testing set, as we should not apply a fitting step on this set, but only the transforming one.

```{r tfidf-trans, eval = FALSE}
tfidf <- TfIdf$new()
dtm_tfidf_train <- dtm_train %>%
  fit_transform(., tfidf)
dtm_tfidf_test <- create_dtm(token_test, vectors) %>%
  transform(tfidf)
```

We once again run our GLM modelling on this transformed set, which gives the following set of AUCs:

```{r glmnet-tfidf-train-auc, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
plot(glmnet_tfidf_train)
```

After running the prediction and confusion matrix functions, we get our last accuracy measure:

```{r glmnet-png-tfidf-acc, echo = FALSE}
pander(bind_rows(glmnet_acc, glmnet_png_acc, glmnet_tfidf_acc))
```

# Modelling results and interpretation

## Classification model


```{r classif-acc, echo = FALSE}
pander(bind_rows(rf_acc, tree_acc, knn_acc))
```

The Random Forest appears relatively weaker than the two other classification algorithms, even though its accuracy is still about twice that of a random choice.

We initially coded the country field based on a list of countries (with more than 20 wines reviewed) extracted from the website interface (and not from the last string of the appellation field), leading to
only 12 possible values for *country* instead of `r length(unique(wines[,"country"]))`, and the Random Forest accuracy under that construction was similar to that of the two other algorithms, at about 0.79.

Overall, the accuracy reached under the last two models appears decent considering the simplicity of the model, with only three explanatory variables, for a three-bucket classification.

## Regression model

```{r regress-acc, echo = FALSE}
pander(bind_rows(glmnet_acc, glmnet_png_acc, glmnet_tfidf_acc))
```

These three algorithms exhibit very similar accuracies, and at a high average of `r round(mean(glmnet_acc[,2], glmnet_png_acc[,2], glmnet_tfidf_acc[,2]),3)`.

Transformations of the DTMs so as to refine the vectors hence do not bring noticeable improvement in the already high accuracy of the base vocabulary vectors. This tends to confirm that the base vocabularies
of Champagnes and non-Champagnes reviews are rather different from scratch, and enable a reliable identification of the underlying wine. This could be for example due to the different kind of grapes
used in both categories of wine, or to references to different kinds of fruit flavors.

# General conclusion and perspectives

This project has enabled us to practice a wide array of teachings covered in the course of the first eight modules of the HarvardX/EdX Professional Certificate in Data Science, from graphic representations
to webscraping to machine learning techniques. Regarding this latter, it has also given us the opportunity to experiment with different approaches of machine learning, with both a classification model and
a regression one, and comparisons betweens different algorithms for each of these models.

There is obviously still room for improvement in both models:  

1. Regarding the classification model, the accuracy, while decent, is not extremely high either. We have tried adding additional explanatory variables, but the gain in accuracy was marginal (and  even negative
for *badge*), while computational times were significantly increased at the algorithm training level. Were it not for the bijection between some wine reviewers and appellations (most notably Roger Voss for Champagnes),
thus leading to some colinearities with the appellations, we feel adding a "reviewer name" explanatory variable in the model could have lifted the accuracy of these three algorithms;  

2. Regarding the regression model, the black box nature of the *cv.glmnet* function makes it difficult to fullt assess the subtleties of the resulting modelling, and hence to evaluate whether some tweakings coul
have been made. However, considering the number of vectors used in the modelling, this function appears extremely time-efficient.

Moreover, we regret not having access to a more frequently populated "user average rating" field, which could have led to some additional fascinating modelling (is the user rating influenced by the professional review rating?
What about the badge or the price? Is the right skew observed in professional ratings for Champagnes, and even more so vintage ones, also observed among site users?).
